## **Revenge of the PETSCII Robots**

* Tested Rollerbot view-cone and shooting timing.
    - Rollerbot shoots at the player if the player is within a cross-shaped viewcone area in the cardinal directions after being spotted.
    - When leaving the Rollerbot's viewcones, a countdown starts before the Rollerbot begins to move again. It resets when reentering the viewcones.
    - Viewcones are actually long rectangles.
* Ongoing large-scale code rework.
    - Restored projectile collision functionality that broke due to a number of code improvements in other areas.
    - Core mechanic checks.
* Rebuilt the player sprite struct to simplfy player sprite decisions.
    - Player sprites are now decided in a struct and function that has a decision cascade based on facing/movement direction and indepenedent turning/shooting direction.
* Integrated deployable weapon/item logic into a parent object for cleaner inheritance.
    - Bomb, EMP, etc.
